#This code prints a slice of the list,  the output retains the structure of the list and includes the first three players in the list.
players = ["charles", "martina", "michael", "florence", "eli"]

#you can generate any subset of a list. Eg, second to to fourth item in a list, you would start the slice at index 1 and end at index 4:
print(players[1:4])

#ommiting first index in a slice, automatically starts at the beginning of the list
print(players[:4])

#similarly, to start at a point till end of the list
print(players[2:])

#Copying a list
# To copy a list, you can make a slice that includes the entire original list by omitting the first index and the second index ([:]). This tells Python to make a slice that starts at the first item and ends with the last item, producing a copy of the entire list.

#Tuples
#A tuple looks like a list, except you use parenthesis instead of square brackets. Tuples are immutable lists. meaning thath you cannot change the list. You can access individual elements using item's index, like lists.

#For example, if we have a rectangle that should always be a certain size, we can ensure that its size doesnâ€™t change by putting the dimensions into a tuple:

dimensions = (200, 5)
print(dimensions[0])
print(dimensions[1])

#dimensions[0] = 250 // trying to change a value results in an error message.

#Looping through all values in a tuple
for dimension in dimensions:
    print(dimension)
    
#Writing over a Tuple
#although you cant modify, you can assign a new value to a variable that represents a tuple.
dimensions = (400, 100)
print(dimensions[0])
print(dimensions[1])
